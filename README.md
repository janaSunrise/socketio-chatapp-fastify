# SocketIO chat app Fastify

A simple chat application made using Fastify and Socket.IO

## Usage

Installation:
```bash
npm install
```
And it'll install dependencies to get you started!

Run the server:
```bash
npm run serve
```

This runs the fastify server, and uses nodemon to update whenever the code is changed.
You can use `node app.js` if you want to host it after editing, or making your own changes.
